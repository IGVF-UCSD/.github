**Hello and Welcome!** This is the central code hub for the UCSD's IGVF award team.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with the Organization Structure
Before you dive in, take a moment to familiarize yourself with how our organization is structured. We have three main repository groups to explore:

#### 1. :gear: Pipeline Repositories 
Contains scripts and utilities essential for setting up and executing pipelines. Here's a snapshot of what a pipeline repo might look like:

#### 2. :file_folder: Dataset Repositories 
**WARNING**: Keep these private until publication of the data. Add collaborators to these repos as necessary.

#### 3. :open_file_folder: Project Repositories 
These are the repositories where the individual projects are housed. You'll find specific codebases, documentation, and other resources relevant to each project here.

**Note**: Each repository contains detailed setup instructions to help you establish a computational environment and perform desired analyses.

### Step 2: Identify the Repository of Interest
Depending on your task, you may find yourself:

- :mag: **Using a repo**: Familiarize yourself with the repository's structure, and consult the repo specific documentation to use the resources effectively.
- :hammer_and_wrench: **Contributing to an existing repo**: Follow normal repository protocol here. Clone the repo, do some work on a new branch, open a pull request
- :computer: **Adding a pipeline, dataset, or project**: If you are starting a new component, such as setting up a new pipeline, preprocessing a new dataset, or initiating a new project, use the respective template repository (pipeline_template, dataset_template, project_template) as a baseline to maintain consistency across the organization.

Utilize the template repositories (`pipeline_template`, `dataset_template`, `project_template`) as your starting point for new ventures.

### Step 3: :speech_balloon: Join in discussions to make suggestions
- Make suggestions for repo additions or enhancements
- Ask questions on how to run things or where to find information
